# myrestfulapi

This is a modern CRUD RESTful API, which uses a Node.js environment, 
running on an Express.js server.

I built this API with the simple aim to practice my knowledge in the back-end. 
I have had the opportunity to built it using the CRUD operations GET, POST, PATCH / PUT,
 and DELETE), which will run the corresponding server commands. 
A route for each endpoint has been set up as well as a function for each query.

To start, please run the commands `npm install` in order to download all 
necessary dependencies. Tip: Create a `.gitignore` file and write node_modules in it to avoid commit unnecessary (and heavy!) files to your GitHub repository. 

I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for Testing and Validating Results of this RESTful application.
 You also can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

nb It is not finished :), as I need to add more features (e.g. error handling, refactor in MVC Pattern, etc).
